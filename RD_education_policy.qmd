## **Overview**  

This study investigates the **causal effects of compulsory schooling requirements** on long-term outcomes, including educational attainment, earnings, marital status, and parental status. Using a *Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD)*, the analysis leverages a policy change implemented on September 1, 1951, which required students to remain in school until at least age 16.  

By examining the impact of this natural experiment, the findings provide policy-relevant insights into the long-term benefits of extending compulsory education, informing decisions on public investment in education, labor market policies, and social mobility initiatives.  

## **Methodology**  

 **Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD)** â†’ Fuzzy RDD approach leveraging the 1951 compulsory schooling reform.  
 **Instrumental Variables (IV)** â†’ Using policy cutoff birthdate to estimate exogenous effects of additional schooling.  


## **Key Findings** 

- Higher educational attainment leads to increased earnings. Individuals who remained in school due to the policy experienced a **13.4% increase in earnings** at age 45.  
- Compulsory schooling impacts marriage rates. Those who stayed in school were **15.4% more likely to be married** at age 45.  
- Schooling influences family formation. Individuals who completed compulsory schooling were **19.4% more likely to have children** by age 45.  
- The Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) is validated. A **strong first-stage relationship** confirms that the **policy effectively increased schooling years**, passing the inclusion condition for IV estimation.  
- Permutation testing confirms robustness.Simulated treatment assignments centered on zero, while the observed effect of schooling remained **statistically significant**, ruling out random chance.  

## **Policy Implications**  

 **Economic Returns to Education** â†’ Justifies public investment in education based on measurable increases in earnings.  
 **Social and Demographic Impact** â†’ Schooling affects family formation trends, influencing housing, welfare, and healthcare policies*  
 **Reducing Inequality** â†’ Ensuring equal access to education promotes social mobility and reduces long-term disparities
