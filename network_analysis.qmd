title: Healthcare Network Analysis - Analyzing Provider Network Structures and Price Transparency
editor: visual
---

## **Overview**  
This project explores **provider network structures** and price transparency in healthcare, focusing on the relationships between providers, networks, and healthcare costs. Using **graph theory, network analysis, and machine learning**, the study identifies key patterns in provider affiliations, network fragmentation, and pricing disparities across different regions and provider types.  

## **Methodology**  
 **Network Analysis** → Constructing provider affiliation networks using National Provider Identifier (NPI) and Tax Identification Number (TIN) connections.  
 **Graph Theory & Centrality Measures** → Identifying highly connected providers and key influencers in the network*  
 **Price Transparency Analysis** → Analyzing variations in healthcare costs and reimbursement rates across different provider networks.  

## **Key Findings**  
- **Highly centralized providers** play a significant role in **negotiating reimbursement rates**, leading to *ricing disparities in certain healthcare markets.  
- Network fragmentation in certain regions results in **restricted patient access** and **higher costs for out-of-network care**.  
- Machine learning clustering techniques reveal distinct patterns in provider group pricing, helping to identify potential **pricing inefficiencies and monopolistic behaviors**.  

## **Policy & Industry Implications**  
 **Healthcare Access & Pricing** → Understanding network fragmentation can inform policy interventions** to **increase price transparency and affordability.  
 **Hospital & Insurer Negotiations** → Insights from centrality analysis can help regulators and stakeholders evaluate provider market power.
